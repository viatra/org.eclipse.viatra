= Setting up the tutorial

This tutorial was written for version 1.6 (released on 28th June 2017).

Starting with version 1.6 VIATRA is available from the Simultaneous Release Train (Oxygen version: http://download.eclipse.org/releases/oxygen); for older releases or for older version use the release p2 repository at http://download.eclipse.org/viatra/updates/release/

For a faster installation, you may deselect the _Contact all update sites during install\..._ field, but then it might be necessary to install the required _Xtext Runtime_ manually.

This document assumes that the CPS metamodels are installed into the Eclipse instance. They are available from the p2 repository http://download.eclipse.org/viatra/examples/cps

VIATRA defines a custom perspective called `Transformation Development` that includes a few views and shortcuts that make it easier to develop queries and transformations. The remainder of the tutorial expects that this perspective is selected; in case a different perspective is used, the corresponding views and wizards are still available in their standard respective locations.
