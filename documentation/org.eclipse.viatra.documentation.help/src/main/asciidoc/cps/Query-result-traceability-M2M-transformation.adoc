This gives a short introduction on the incremental query result traceability M2M transformation.

## Introduction

This transformation variant is closely related to the <<Explicit-traceability-M2M-transformation#,Explicit Traceability>> variant. The concept of this transformation method is to use VIATRA Query patterns on the CPS model and react to changes in the match results by updating the deployment and traceability models incrementally. 

## How does it work

This transformation method is heavily based on thelink:https://wiki.eclipse.org/VIATRA/Transformation/EventDrivenVM[Event-driven Virtual Machine (EVM)] provided by VIATRA. Each transformation step is triggered by an appearing or disappearing VIATRA Query pattern match. The transformation steps are detailed in the listing below.

* **HostInstance**
** Related patterns:
*** _hostInstance_ (Event Trigger)
*** _cps2depTrace_ (Used in transformation)
** Appear: Create a new DeploymentHost in the deployment model representing the appeared HostInstance. Add trace to traceability.
** Update: Update the IP address if required.
** Disappear: Remove the DeploymentHost representing the disappeared HostInstance from the deployment model. Remove trace from traceability.
* **ApplicationInstance**
** Related patterns:
*** _applicationInstance_ (Event Trigger)
*** _cps2depTrace_ (Used in transformation)
** Appear: Create a new DeploymentApplication in the deployment model representing the appeared ApplicationInstance. Add trace to traceability.
** Update: Update the id if required.
** Disappear: Remove the DeploymentApplication representing the disappeared ApplicationInstance from the deployment model. Remove trace from traceability.
* **StateMachine**
** Related patterns:
*** _stateMachine_ (Event Trigger)
*** _applicationInstance_ (Referenced by event trigger)
*** _cps2depTrace_ (Used in transformation)
** Appear: Create a new DeploymentBehavior in the deployment model representing the appeared StateMachine for the ApplicationInstance specified by the pattern. This happens for every ApplicationInstance with a type that defines the StateMachine. Add DeploymentBehavior to proper trace in traceability. If it does not exist, create it.
** Update: Update the description if required.
** Disappear: Remove the DeploymentBehaviors representing the disappeared StateMachines from the deployment model. Remove DeploymentBehavior from proper trace in traceability. If no DeploymentBehaviors are left in the trace, remove it.
* **State**
** Related patterns:
*** _state_ (Event Trigger)
*** _stateMachine_ (Referenced by event trigger)
*** _applicationInstance_ (Referenced by event trigger)
*** _cps2depTrace_ (Used in transformation)
** Appear: Create a new BehaviorState in the deployment model representing the appeared State for the ApplicationInstance specified by the pattern. This happens for every ApplicationInstance with a type that defines the StateMachine containing the State. Set the DeploymentBehavior's current state to the created BehaviorState if the original State was an initial state of it's state machine. Add BehaviorState to proper trace in traceability. If it does not exist, create it.
** Update: Update the description and the current state of the state machine if required.
** Disappear: Remove the BehaviorStates representing the disappeared State from the deployment model. If this BehaviorState was the current state of it's DeploymentBehavior, set the behavior's current state to null. Remove BehaviorStates from proper trace in traceability. If no BehaviorStates are left in the trace, remove it.
* **Transition**
** Related patterns:
*** _transition_ (Event Trigger)
*** _state_ (Referenced by event trigger) 
*** _stateMachine_ (Referenced by event trigger)
*** _applicationInstance_ (Referenced by event trigger)
*** _cps2depTrace_ (Used in transformation)
*** _depBehaviorsStateAndTransitions_ (Used in transformation)
** Appear: Create a new BehaviorTransition in the deployment model representing the appeared State for the ApplicationInstance specified by the pattern. This happens for every ApplicationInstance with a type that defines the StateMachine containing the State containing the Transition. Add BehaviorTransition to proper trace in traceability. If it does not exist, create it.
** Update: Update the description, the source and target states if required.
** Disappear: Remove the BehaviorTransitions representing the disappeared Transition from the deployment model. Remove BehaviorTransitions from proper trace in traceability. If no BehaviorTransitions are left in the trace, remove it.
* **Trigger**
** Related patterns:
*** _triggerPair_ (Event Trigger)
*** _sendTransitionAppSignal_ (Referenced by event trigger)
*** _waitTransitionAppSignal_ (Referenced by event trigger)
*** _appInstanceTransition_ (Referenced by event trigger)
*** _applicationInstance_ (Referenced by event trigger)
*** _applicationInstanceWithHost_ (Referenced by event trigger)
*** _reachableHosts_ (Referenced by event trigger)
*** _hostCommunication_ (Referenced by event trigger)
*** _cps2depTrace_ (Used in transformation)
** Appear: Set the trigger between the BehaviorTransitions representing the matched Transitions.
** Disappear: Remove the trigger between the BehaviorTransitions representing the matched Transitions.

To resolve ordering issues, the events processing order is defined based on priorities as follows:
HostInstance > ApplicationInstance > StateMachine > State > Transition > Trigger

(A > B means event A will be processed before event B)

The above order is true for each appear and update event. In the case of disappear events the order is reversed.

## Handling of 1-to-n mappings

The 1-to-n mappings are mainly handled inside the event trigger patterns. Each pattern is written in a way so that it will create an event for each applicable ApplicationInstance, e.g. if a new State is added to the CPS model and there are 3 ApplicationInstances of the type that defines the StateMachine, then 3 appeared events will occur, and each of them will add a new BehaviorState to the corresponding DeploymentApplication's DeploymentBehavior.

## Creation of triggers

Detecting new trigger pairs is entirely the job of VIATRA Query using the above specified patterns.

## Class of the transformation

The implementation of the transformation can be found in the following class:
`CPS2DeploymentTransformationQrt.xtend`

## Summary and comparison

Compared to the Explicit Traceability version, the reduced pattern complexity of this transformation method allows more memory efficient transformation at the price of loosing the ability to start the transformation on an already existing, partially transformed model. The speed of the transformation is comparable to that of the Explicit Traceability, while its memory consumption is more akin to the <<Simple-Xtend-and-Query-M2M-transformation#,Simple Xtend and Query>> variant.
